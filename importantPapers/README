1 About the paper of idle sense:
- It's not exactly the same as Schedule Reset.
- They also listen to 'consecutive' empty slots in order to converge to the same CW in all nodes.
- We actually do not want to converge to a single CW.
- It's true that having different CW will be unfair, albeit that is without Fair Share.
- FURTHER, in the experiments we identify an empty slot as the one lacking PLCP headers.
