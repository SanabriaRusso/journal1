All of these results are not valid for calculation of the queueing delay or blocking probability, at least not the saturation case.

That is because these were generated with a deactivated source, so the measures of queueing delay are not real.

The raw files for computing the queueing delay or blocking probability are on the respective folders for the saturated case.
